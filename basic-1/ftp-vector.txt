The ftp vector was very simple. The device was descovered with an nmap ping sweep (nmap -sn 192.168.1.1/24). Next,
the device was scanned with nmap's aggressive scan (nmap -A 192.168.1.6). This found the ftp service. When the host
was scanned in Armitage (via the hail marry), the ftp service was descovered to have a backdoor. I sent this result to Metasploit
(I don't like the shell interaction within Armitage), and got a shell on the system. I was able to cd to the root directory, 
and write and read files.
This vector was very very simple, and required very little knowledge of the tools. The backdoor had root priv, so I didn't even
have to do a priv esc. This vector was also the simplest of the 3 I found (others being webserver and ssh).
