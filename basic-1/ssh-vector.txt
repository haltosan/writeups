The ssh vector was not successful. 
I discovered the host using Nmap ping sweep (nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24). The ip was 192.168.1.6. Next, I found the services
using Nmapâ€™s aggressive scan (nmap -A 192.168.1.6). The attack I tried was a password brute force. I used the fasttrack
wordlist with hydra against the user marlinspike, the current user (hydra -l marlinspike -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt
192.168.1.6 ssh -t 4), but the attack did not prove successful. I also ran through all Linux/Unix ssh exploits in Metasploit
and individually tried each. None of these worked either. This vector was not a very long or hard attack, but sadly did not
work.

The results were stored in Faraday, and then exported in the Faraday-SR-basic-1.csv file. This was also my first time using
Faraday, and I very much enjoyed the result exporting and command history. I hope to use Faraday more in the future.
